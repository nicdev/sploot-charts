    # This UNIQUE name is prepended or prefixed to the proxy/shared-flow bundle name to distinguish them from other

  # The api-proxies under the entitlements-registration section should correspond to the api-proxies under either
  # specs or bundles section and is a required section, if any one of the two is provided. This means that the
  # name of the api-proxies under either specs or bundles should match with the api-proxies name under entitlements
  # registration.
  # This is to facilitate the deployed apigee proxy's registration with the NCR entitlements service. So, for example,
  # if we have 2 proxy bundles to be deployed under the bundles/api-proxies section, the
  # api-manifest/api-proxies must also have two set of values each corresponding to the two proxies so as to make sure
  # of their registration with entitlements service.
